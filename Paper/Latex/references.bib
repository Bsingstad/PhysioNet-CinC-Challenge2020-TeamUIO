	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used reliable, non-invasive approach for cardiovascular disease diagnosis. With the rapid growth of ECG examinations and the insufficiency of cardiologists, accurate and automatic diagnosis of ECG signals has become a hot research topic. Deep learning methods have demonstrated promising results in predictive healthcare tasks. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network for multi-label classification of cardiac arrhythmias in 12-lead ECG recordings. Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.970 and an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features. Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I, aVR, and V5 among 12 leads. Finally, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the model's behavior at both patient level and population level.

	abstract = {Electrocardiography is a very common, non-invasive diagnostic procedure and its interpretation is increasingly supported by automatic interpretation algorithms. The progress in the field of automatic ECG interpretation has up to now been hampered by a lack of appropriate datasets for training as well as a lack of well-defined evaluation procedures to ensure comparability of different algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we put forward first benchmarking results for the recently published, freely accessible PTB-XL dataset, covering a variety of tasks from different ECG statement prediction tasks over age and gender prediction to signal quality assessment. We find that convolutional neural networks, in particular resnet- and inception-based architectures, show the strongest performance across all tasks outperforming feature-based algorithms by a large margin. These results are complemented by deeper insights into the classification algorithm in terms of hidden stratification, model uncertainty and an exploratory interpretability analysis. We also put forward benchmarking results for the ICBEB2018 challenge ECG dataset and discuss prospects of transfer learning using classifiers pretrained on PTB-XL. With this resource, we aim to establish the PTB-XL dataset as a resource for structured benchmarking of ECG analysis algorithms and encourage other researchers in the field to join these efforts.},

	abstract = {This study proposed an ECG (Electrocardiogram) classification approach using machine learning based on several ECG features. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that measures the electric activity of the heart. The proposed approach is implemented using ML-libs and Scala language on Apache Spark framework; MLlib is Apache Spark’s scalable machine learning library. The key challenge in ECG classification is to handle the irregularities in the ECG signals which is very important to detect the patient status. Therefore, we have proposed an efficient approach to classify ECG signals with high accuracy Each heartbeat is a combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac heart tissues. Heartbeats classification faces some difficulties because these waveforms differ from person to another, they are described by some features. These features are the inputs of machine learning algorithm. In general, using Spark–Scala tools simplifies the usage of many algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) algorithms. On other hand, Spark–Scala is preferred to be used more than other tools when size of processing data is too large. In our case, we have used a dataset with 205,146 records to evaluate the performance of our approach. Machine learning libraries in Spark–Scala provide easy ways to implement many classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees (GDB), etc.). The proposed method is evaluated and validated on baseline MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia database. The results show that our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 96.75\% using GDB Tree algorithm and 97.98\% using random Forest for binary classification. For multi class classification, it achieved to 98.03\% accuracy using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting tree supports only binary classification.},

	abstract = {Detecting and classifying cardiac arrhythmias is critical to the diagnosis of patients with cardiac abnormalities. In this paper, a novel approach based on deep learning methodology is proposed for the classification of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We demonstrate the application of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and deep belief networks (DBN) for ECG classification following detection of ventricular and supraventricular heartbeats using single-lead ECG. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is illustrated using real ECG signals from the widely-used MIT-BIH database. Simulation results demonstrate that with a suitable choice of parameters, RBM and DBN can achieve high average recognition accuracies of ventricular ectopic beats (93.63\%) and of supraventricular ectopic beats (95.57\%) at a low sampling rate of 114 Hz. Experimental results indicate that classifiers built into this deep learning-based framework achieved state-of-the art performance models at lower sampling rates and simple features when compared to traditional methods. Further, employing features extracted at a sampling rate of 114 Hz when combined with deep learning provided enough discriminatory power for the classification task. This performance is comparable to that of traditional methods and uses a much lower sampling rate and simpler features. Thus, our proposed deep neural network algorithm demonstrates that deep learning-based methods offer accurate ECG classification and could potentially be extended to other physiological signal classifications, such as those in arterial blood pressure (ABP), nerve conduction (EMG), and heart rate variability (HRV) studies.},

We evaluate modularity-maximizing using fast greedy and leading eigenvector approximations, infomap, walktrap and label propagation algorithms. For this purpose, we propose to construct a label co-occurrence graph (both weighted and unweighted versions) based on training data and perform community detection to partition the label set. Then, each partition constitutes a label space for separate multi-label classification sub-problems. As a result, we obtain an ensemble of multi-label classifiers that jointly covers the whole label space. Based on the binary relevance and label powerset classification methods, we compare community detection methods to label space divisions against random baselines on 12 benchmark datasets over five evaluation measures. We discover that data-driven approaches are more efficient and more likely to outperform RAkELd than binary relevance or label powerset is, in every evaluated measure. For all measures, apart from Hamming loss, data-driven approaches are significantly better than RAkELd (    α = 0 . 05    ), and at least one data-driven approach is more likely to outperform RAkELd than a priori methods in the case of RAkELd’s best performance.

	abstract = {The first electrocardiogram (ECG) from the intact human heart was recorded with a mercury capillary electrometer by Augustus Waller in May 1887 at St. Mary's Hospital, London. The tracings were poor and exhibited only 2 distorted deflections. Willem Einthoven (1860-1927) who was professor of physiology at the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, began his studies of the ECG with the mercury capillary electrometer, and improved its distortion mathematically so that he was finally able to register a good representation of the ECG before the beginning of the twentieth century. He later further improved ECG recordings with the introduction of a string galvanometer of his design. Einthoven published his first article about the string galvanometer in 1901, followed by a more detailed description in 1903 which included a report of ECGs taken with the new instrument. The year 2002 marks the centennial of Willem Einthoven's first recording of the ECG in a clinically applicable fashion with the string galvanometer. The clinical use of Einthoven's immobile equipment required transtelephonic transmission of the ECG from the physiology laboratory to the clinic at the Academic Hospital about a mile away as documented in the 1906 paper on the "télécardiogramme". This report contained a wealth of ECG patterns and arrhythmias. Einthoven developed a system of electrocardiographic standardization that continues to be used all over the world and introduced the triaxial bipolar system with 3 limb leads and thus established uniformity of the recording process. Einthoven also conceived the famous equilateral triangle with leads I, II, and III at its sides and the calculation of the electrical axis (in the frontal plane) depicted as a single vector with an arrow at the center of the triangle. Einthoven recognized the great potential importance of the ECG as a diagnostic and investigative tool and his achievements made him the founder of modern electrocardiography. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1924 (2 years after Waller's death) in physiology and medicine, "for the discovery of the mechanism of the electrocardiogram."},

Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers.

Large networks are also slow to use, making it diﬃcult to deal with overﬁtting by combining the predictions of many diﬀerent large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of diﬀerent “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the eﬀect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This signiﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classiﬁcation and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

	abstract = {It this paper we revisit the fast stylization method introduced in Ulyanov et. al. (2016). We show how a small change in the stylization architecture results in a significant qualitative improvement in the generated images. The change is limited to swapping batch normalization with instance normalization, and to apply the latter both at training and testing times. The resulting method can be used to train high-performance architectures for real-time image generation. The code will is made available on github at https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/texture\_nets.

@article{ioffe_batch_nodate,
	title = {Batch {Normalization}: {Accelerating} {Deep} {Network} {Training} by {Reducing} {Internal} {Covariate} {Shift}},
	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

Since then, automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer makes its own errors—sometimes critical—in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (CIE) was introduced to improve the correct interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG), facilitating health care decision making and reducing costs. Worldwide, millions of ECGs are recorded annually, with the majority automatically analyzed, followed by an immediate interpretation. Limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of CIE were soon recognized and still persist, despite ongoing improvement in ECG algorithms. Unfortunately, inexperienced physicians ordering the ECG may fail to recognize interpretation mistakes and accept the automated diagnosis without criticism. Clinical mismanagement may result, with the risk of exposing patients to useless investigations or potentially dangerous treatment. Consequently, CIE over-reading and conﬁrmation by an experienced ECG reader are essential and are repeatedly recommended in published reports. Implementation of new ECG knowledge is also important. The current status of automated ECG interpretation is reviewed, with suggestions for improvement. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:1183–92) © 2017 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability has been largely used for the assessment of cardiac autonomic activity, due to the direct relationship between cardiac rhythm and the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. In recent years, another technique, pulse rate variability, has been used for assessing heart rate variability information from pulse wave signals, especially from photoplethysmography, a non-invasive, non-intrusive, optical technique that measures the blood volume in tissue. The relationship, however, between pulse rate variability and heart rate variability is not entirely understood, and the effects of cardiovascular changes in pulse rate variability have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the applications in which pulse rate variability has been used, with a special focus on cardiovascular health, and of the studies that have compared heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is presented. It was found that the relationship between heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is not entirely understood yet, and that pulse rate variability might be influenced not only due to technical aspects but also by physiological factors that might affect the measurements obtained from pulse-to-pulse time series extracted from pulse waves. Hence, pulse rate variability must not be considered as a valid surrogate of heart rate variability in all scenarios, and care must be taken when using pulse rate variability instead of heart rate variability. Specifically, the way pulse rate variability is affected by cardiovascular changes does not necessarily reflect the same information as heart rate variability, and might contain further valuable information. More research regarding the relationship between cardiovascular changes and pulse rate variability should be performed to evaluate if pulse rate variability might be useful for the assessment of not only cardiac autonomic activity but also for the analysis of mechanical and vascular autonomic responses to these changes.},

Further, to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of HRV extraction from PPG signal, finger-tip PPG and standard lead II ECG signals were simultaneously. A comparative analysis of time domain and frequency domain measures of PRV was carried out. Finally, we present a method of PRV analysis to evaluate mental stress by simple PPG.

The Photoplethsmographic (PPG) and Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals from 33 participants were recorded simultaneoussly during resting and exercise conditions. The peaks of PPG and R-waves of ECG were detected and reconstructed to the Peak-to-Peak interval (PPI) and R-to-R interval (RRI) waveforms respectively. In both conditions, the mean and standard deviation (SDNN) of the intervals over 5 minutes were computed from the two waveforms. Results from cross correlation between PPI and RRI show that the average correlation coefficients (r) are higher in resting than the “r” in exercise. In regression analysis of the statistical parameters between RRI and PPI, the determination coefficients (R2) of the means are close to one in both conditions, whereas the R2 of SDNN in exercise is lower than the one in resting. This finding suggests that the HRV indices can be evaluated from PPG with reliability during the rest.},

Alternatives to HRV monitoring, like photoplethysmography (PPG), are being explored as cheaper and unobtrusive non-invasive technologies. We report a new wireless PPG sensor that was tested in detecting changes in HRV, elicited by a mentally stressful task, and to determine if its signal can be used as a surrogate of ECG for HRV analysis. Data were collected simultaneously from volunteers using a PPG and ECG sensor, during a resting and a mentally stressful task. HRV metrics were extracted from these signals and compared to determine the agreement between them and to determine if any changes occurred in the metrics due to the stressful task. For both tasks, a moderate/good agreement was found in the mean interbeat intervals, SDNN, LF, and SD2, and a poor agreement for the pNN50, RMSSD{\textbar}SD1, and HF metrics. The majority of the tested HRV metrics obtained from the PPG signal showed a significant decrease caused by the mental task. The disagreement found between specific HRV features imposes caution when comparing metrics from different technologies. Nevertheless, the tested sensor was successful at detecting changes in the HRV caused by a mental stressor.},

	abstract = {Heart rate variability has been largely used for the assessment of cardiac autonomic activity, due to the direct relationship between cardiac rhythm and the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. In recent years, another technique, pulse rate variability, has been used for assessing heart rate variability information from pulse wave signals, especially from photoplethysmography, a non-invasive, non-intrusive, optical technique that measures the blood volume in tissue. The relationship, however, between pulse rate variability and heart rate variability is not entirely understood, and the effects of cardiovascular changes in pulse rate variability have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the applications in which pulse rate variability has been used, with a special focus on cardiovascular health, and of the studies that have compared heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is presented. It was found that the relationship between heart rate variability and pulse rate variability is not entirely understood yet, and that pulse rate variability might be influenced not only due to technical aspects but also by physiological factors that might affect the measurements obtained from pulse-to-pulse time series extracted from pulse waves. Hence, pulse rate variability must not be considered as a valid surrogate of heart rate variability in all scenarios, and care must be taken when using pulse rate variability instead of heart rate variability. Specifically, the way pulse rate variability is affected by cardiovascular changes does not necessarily reflect the same information as heart rate variability, and might contain further valuable information. More research regarding the relationship between cardiovascular changes and pulse rate variability should be performed to evaluate if pulse rate variability might be useful for the assessment of not only cardiac autonomic activity but also for the analysis of mechanical and vascular autonomic responses to these changes.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of heart rates from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during intense physical activity is a very challenging problem. This is because strenuous and high intensity exercise can result in severe motion artifacts in PPG signals, making accurate heart rate (HR) estimation difficult. In this study we investigated a novel technique to accurately reconstruct motion-corrupted PPG signals and HR based on time-varying spectral analysis. The algorithm is called Spectral filter algorithm for Motion Artifacts and heart rate reconstruction (SpaMA). The idea is to calculate the power spectral density of both PPG and accelerometer signals for each time shift of a windowed data segment. By comparing time-varying spectra of PPG and accelerometer data, those frequency peaks resulting from motion artifacts can be distinguished from the PPG spectrum. The SpaMA approach was applied to three different datasets and four types of activities: (1) training datasets from the 2015 IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 12 subjects while performing treadmill exercise from 1 km/h to 15 km/h; (2) test datasets from the 2015 IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 11 subjects while performing forearm and upper arm exercise. (3) Chon Lab dataset including 10 min recordings from 10 subjects during treadmill exercise. The ECG signals from all three datasets provided the reference HRs which were used to determine the accuracy of our SpaMA algorithm. The performance of the SpaMA approach was calculated by computing the mean absolute error between the estimated HR from the PPG and the reference HR from the ECG. The average estimation errors using our method on the first, second and third datasets are 0.89, 1.93 and 1.38 beats/min respectively, while the overall error on all 33 subjects is 1.86 beats/min and the performance on only treadmill experiment datasets (22 subjects) is 1.11 beats/min. Moreover, it was found that dynamics of heart rate variability can be accurately captured using the algorithm where the mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the power spectral densities of the reference and the reconstructed heart rate time series was found to be 0.98. These results show that the SpaMA method has a potential for PPG-based HR monitoring in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring during intense physical activities.},

Studies comparing the electrocardiographic index with echocardiography in hypertensive patients and reporting sufficient data were included., Data extraction Data on study populations, echocardiographic criteria, and methodological quality of studies were extracted., Data synthesis Negative likelihood ratios, which indicate to what extent the posterior odds of left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced by a negative test, were calculated., Results 21 studies and data on 5608 patients were analysed. The median prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 33\% (interquartile range 23-41\%) in primary care settings (10 studies) and 65\% (37-81\%) in secondary care settings (11 studies). The median negative likelihood ratio was similar across electrocardiographic indexes, ranging from 0.85 (range 0.34-1.03) for the Romhilt-Estes score (with threshold ≥4 points) to 0.91 (0.70-1.01) for the Gubner index. Using the Romhilt-Estes score in primary care, a negative electrocardiogram result would reduce the typical pre-test probability from 33\% to 31\%. In secondary care the typical pre-test probability of 65\% would be reduced to 63\%., Conclusion Electrocardiographic criteria should not be used to rule out left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.},

Occasionally, however, exercise may act as a trigger for arrhythmic death in athletes who harbor an occult pathological substrate. The majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) in young athletes (≤35 years old) are secondary to inherited cardiac diseases, while ischaemic heart disease predominates in older athletes. In the absence of compulsory national or international registries of SCD in athletes, it is difficult to define the exact scale of the problem. In addition, the lack of post-mortem evaluation by pathologists with expertise in cardiac adaptation to exercise and inherited cardiac diseases casts doubt to the reliability of the reported causes. The proposed preventative strategies focus primarily on preventing deaths by cardiovascular evaluation of athletes and the use of automated external defibrillators in athletic venues. Cardiovascular screening of first-degree relatives, though often neglected, has the potential to avert further tragedies given the inherited nature of most conditions predisposing to SCD in the young. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology and causes of SCD in athletes and explores potential prevention strategies.},

To provide the reader with an overview of the many causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and to present various strategies for preparticipation cardiovascular screening.

Data Source:
A MEDLINE search using the phrase sudden cardiac death and the key word athlete for the years 1980 to 2000.

Data Synthesis:
Sudden cardiac death is a rare event in athletics. More than 20 different causes have been described, but most cases result from a few distinct entities. Most afflicted athletes have no symptoms before death. Many attempts have been made to detect those at risk for sudden cardiac death before athletic participation. At this time, a thorough history and physical examination are the most efficient screening methods for detecting cardiovascular abnormalities. Studies show that the current status of preparticipation cardiovascular screening of high school and college athletes nationwide is poor.

Conclusions and Recommendations:
The use of diagnostic tests to screen for cardiovascular abnormalities is ineffective and inefficient. The most prudent and effective methods of preparticipation screening for cardiovascular abnormalities at this time are a history and physical examination in accordance with the American Heart Association guidelines. Athletic trainers must ensure that their institutions comply with these minimum standards.},

	abstract = {Due to high dimensionality and multiple variables, unsupervised classification of 12-lead ECG signals involves challenges and difficulties. In order to automatically discover unknown physiological features from raw multivariate signals and detect abnormal cardiac activities of a subject, we proposed an unsupervised classification scheme of 12-lead ECG signals using wavelet tensor decomposition and two-dimensional Gaussian spectral clustering. After filtering and segmentation, each ECG sample is converted into a wavelet tensor by the Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). Main features of ECG samples can be clearly investigated in a multiple feature space constructed by the ECG lead, time and frequency sub-band. Then the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of ECG tensors as well as preserve the data interior structure. Taking account of both magnitude and orientation of feature vectors, a novel two-dimensional Gaussian spectral clustering (TGSC) is devised to cluster different 12-lead ECG samples. Furthermore, the dataset obtained from practical 12-lead ECG experiment and two datasets from PhysioBank are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. Clustering results show that more useful features of ECG signals can be extracted by the wavelet-tensor-based MPCA than by vector-based PCA. With the two-dimensional Gaussian proximity matrix, the clustering accuracy of TGSC is also higher than that of the traditional spectral clustering.},

Highly accurate diagnosis of AF based on 12-lead ECG is valuable and remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method with high accuracy for AF detection based on deep learning. The proposed method constructed a novel one-dimensional deep densely connected neural network (DDNN) to detect AF in ECG waveforms with a length of 10s. A large set of 16,557 12-lead ECG recordings collected from multiple hospitals and wearable ECG devices were used to evaluate the performance of the DDNN. In the test dataset (3312 12-lead ECG recordings), the DDNN obtained high performance with an accuracy of 99.35 ± 0.26\%, a sensitivity of 99.19 ± 0.31\%, and a specificity of 99.44 ± 0.17\%. Its high performance and automatic nature both demonstrate that the proposed network has a great potential to be applied to clinical computer-aided diagnosis of AF or future screening of AF in wearable devices.},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00\% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Automatic or semi-automatic analysis of the equine electrocardiogram (eECG) is currently not possible because human or small animal ECG analysis software is unreliable due to a different ECG morphology in horses resulting from a different cardiac innervation. Both filtering, beat detection to classification for eECGs are currently poorly or not described in the literature. There are also no public databases available for eECGs as is the case for human ECGs. In this paper we propose the use of wavelet transforms for both filtering and QRS detection in eECGs. In addition, we propose a novel robust deep neural network using a parallel convolutional neural network architecture for ECG beat classification. The network was trained and tested using both the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and an own made eECG dataset with 26.440 beats on 4 classes: normal, premature ventricular contraction, premature atrial contraction and noise. The network was optimized using a genetic algorithm and an accuracy of 97.7\% and 92.6\% was achieved for the MIT-BIH and eECG database respectively. Afterwards, transfer learning from the MIT-BIH dataset to the eECG database was applied after which the average accuracy, recall, positive predictive value and F1 score of the network increased with an accuracy of 97.1\%.},

	abstract = {The performance of automatic speech recognition can often be signiﬁcantly improved by combining multiple systems together. Though beneﬁcial, ensemble methods can be computationally expensive, often requiring multiple decoding runs. An alternative approach, appropriate for deep learning schemes, is to adopt student-teacher training. Here, a student model is trained to reproduce the outputs of a teacher model, or ensemble of teachers. The standard approach is to train the student model on the frame posterior outputs of the teacher. This paper examines the interaction between student-teacher training schemes and sequence training criteria, which have been shown to yield signiﬁcant performance gains over frame-level criteria. There are several possible options for integrating sequence training, including training of the ensemble and further training of the student. This paper also proposes an extension to the studentteacher framework, where the student is trained to emulate the hypothesis posterior distribution of the teacher, or ensemble of teachers. This sequence student-teacher training approach allows the beneﬁt of student-teacher training to be directly combined with sequence training schemes. These approaches are evaluated on two speech recognition tasks: a Wall Street Journal based task and a low-resource Tok Pisin conversational telephone speech task from the IARPA Babel programme.},

	abstract = {We exploit a self-supervised deep multi-task learning framework for electrocardiogram (ECG) -based emotion recognition. The proposed solution consists of two stages of learning a) learning ECG representations and b) learning to classify emotions. ECG representations are learned by a signal transformation recognition network. The network learns high-level abstract representations from unlabeled ECG data. Six different signal transformations are applied to the ECG signals, and transformation recognition is performed as pretext tasks. Training the model on pretext tasks helps the network learn spatiotemporal representations that generalize well across different datasets and different emotion categories. We transfer the weights of the self-supervised network to an emotion recognition network, where the convolutional layers are kept frozen and the dense layers are trained with labelled ECG data. We show that the proposed solution considerably improves the performance compared to a network trained using fully-supervised learning. New state-of-the-art results are set in classification of arousal, valence, affective states, and stress for the four utilized datasets. Extensive experiments are performed, providing interesting insights into the impact of using a multi-task self-supervised structure instead of a single-task model, as well as the optimum level of difficulty required for the pretext self-supervised tasks.},

Despite growing interest in ECG authentication, there are still two main problems that need to be tackled, i.e., the accuracy and processing speed. Therefore, this paper proposed a fast and accurate ECG authentication utilizing only two stages, i.e., ECG beat detection and classification. By minimizing time-consuming ECG signal pre-processing and feature extraction, our proposed two-stage algorithm can authenticate the ECG signal around 660 \&mu;s. Hamilton\&rsquo;s method was used for ECG beat detection, while the Residual Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network (RDSCNN) algorithm was used for classification. It was found that between six and eight ECG beats were required for authentication of different databases. Results showed that our proposed algorithm achieved 100\% accuracy when evaluated with 48 patients in the MIT-BIH database and 90 people in the ECG ID database. These results showed that our proposed algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

However, it is very labor intensive to externally evaluate ECG signals, due to their small amplitude. Using automated detection and classification methods in the clinic can assist doctors in making accurate and expeditious diagnoses of diseases. In this study, we developed a classification method for arrhythmia based on the combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, which was then used to diagnose eight ECG signals, including a normal sinus rhythm. The ECG data of the experiment were derived from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The experimental method mainly consisted of two parts. The input data of the model were two-dimensional grayscale images converted from one-dimensional signals, and detection and classification of the input data was carried out using the combined model. The advantage of this method is that it does not require performing feature extraction or noise filtering on the ECG signal. The experimental results showed that the implemented method demonstrated high classification performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity equal to 99.01\%, 99.57\%, and 97.67\%, respectively.

Arrhythmias are irregularities in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat which, in some cases, may occur sporadically in a subject’s daily life. To capture these infrequent events, a Holter device is usually employed to record long-term ECG data. Therefore, the automatic recognition of abnormal heartbeats from a large amount of ECG data is an important and essential task. In the last two decades, a huge number of methods have been proposed to address the problem of ECG beat classification. At the same time, deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance in various fields. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for ECG beat classification. We have conducted the experiments on the well-known MIT–BIH Arrhythmia Database, and compared our results with the scientific literature. The final results show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art in terms of accuracy, but also competitive in terms of sensitivity and specificity.},

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a simpler, more noise-immune solution than traditional methods in multi-class arrhythmia classification. However, suffering from lack of consideration for temporal feature of ECG signal, CNN couldn’t accept varied-length ECG signal and had limited performance in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. To address these issues, we proposed attention-based time-incremental convolutional neural network (ATI-CNN), a deep neural network model achieving both spatial and temporal fusion of information from ECG signals by integrating CNN, recurrent cells and attention module. Comparing to CNN model, this model features flexible input length, halved parameter amount as well as more than 90\% computation reduction in real-time processing. The experiment result shows that, ATI-CNN reached an overall classification accuracy of 81.2\%. In comparison with a classical 16-layer CNN named VGGNet, ATI-CNN achieved accuracy increases of 7.7\% in average and up to 26.8\% in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. Combining all these excellent features, ATI-CNN offered an exemplification for all kinds of varied-length signal processing problems.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a myocardial anoxic incapacitation caused by severe cardiovascular obstruction that can cause irreversible injury or even death. In medical field, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common and effective way to diagnose myocardial infarction, which often requires a wealth of medical knowledge. It is necessary to develop an approach that can detect the MI automatically. Methods: In this paper, we propose a multi-branch fusion framework for automatic MI screening from 12-lead ECG images, which consists of multi-branch network, feature fusion and classification network. First, we use text detection and position alignment to automatically separate twelve leads from ECG images. Then, those 12 leads are input into the multi-branch network constructed by a shallow neural network to get 12 feature maps. After concatenating those feature maps by depth fusion, classification is explored to judge the given ECG is MI or not. Results: Based on extensive experiments on an ECG image dataset, performances of different combinations of structures are analyzed. The proposed network is compared with other networks and also compared with physicians in the practical use. All the experiments verify that the proposed method is effective for MI screening based on ECG images, which achieves accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score of 94.73\%, 96.41\%, 95.94\% and 93.79\% respectively. Conclusions: Rather than using the typical one-dimensional electrical ECG signal, this paper gives an effective model to screen MI by analyzing 12-lead ECG images. Extracting and analyzing these 12 leads from their corresponding ECG images is a good attempt in the application of MI screening.},

Here we present a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80\% and specificity over 99\%. These results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00\% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units.},

Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33\% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing.},

The athletes presented a very low level of psychological stress before and a slight decrease immediately after the examination as measured by the REST-Q 76 Sport questionnaire. Athletes needing further examinations did not present a higher level of stress after the initial examination compared with athletes with normal test results. Overall, very few athletes were diagnosed with a cardiac condition that increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

While Explainable AI is an emerging field of research, there is no consensus on the definition, quantification, and formalization of explainability. In fact, the quantification of explainability is an open challenge. In our previous work, we incorporated domain knowledge for better explainability, however, we were unable to quantify the extent of explainability. In this work, we (1) briefly analyze the definitions of explainability from the perspective of different disciplines (e.g., psychology, social science), properties of explanation, explanation methods, and human-friendly explanations; and (2) propose and formulate an approach to quantify the extent of explainability. Our experimental result suggests a reasonable and model-agnostic way to quantify explainability},

	abstract = {Test based on electrocardiograms (ECG) that record the heart electrical activity can help in early detection of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) where the heart muscle is partially thickened and blood flow is (potentially fatally) obstructed. This paper presents a cardiovascular-patient classifier we developed to identify HCM patients using standard 10-seconds, 12-lead ECG signals. Patients are classified as having HCM if the majority of the heartbeats are recognized as HCM. Thus, the classifier's underlying task is to recognize individual heartbeats segmented from 12-lead ECG signals as HCM beats, where heartbeats from non-HCM cardiovascular patients are used as controls. We extracted 504 morphological and temporal features - both commonly used and newly-developed ones-from ECG signals for heartbeat classification. To assess classification performance, we trained and tested a random forest classifier and a support vector machine classifier using 5-fold cross validation. The patient-classification precision of both classifiers are close to 0.85. Recall (sensitivity) and specificity are approximately 0.90. We also conducted feature selection experiments by gradually removing the least informative features; the results show that a relatively small subset of 304 highly informative features can achieve performance measures comparable to that achieved by using the complete set of features.},

	abstract = {Background
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an uncommon but important cause of sudden cardiac death.
Objectives
This study sought to develop an artificial intelligence approach for the detection of HCM based on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).
Methods
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and validated using digital 12-lead ECG from 2,448 patients with a verified HCM diagnosis and 51,153 non-HCM age- and sex-matched control subjects. The ability of the CNN to detect HCM was then tested on a different dataset of 612 HCM and 12,788 control subjects.
Results
In the combined datasets, mean age was 54.8 ± 15.9 years for the HCM group and 57.5 ± 15.5 years for the control group. After training and validation, the area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN in the validation dataset was 0.95 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94 to 0.97) at the optimal probability threshold of 11\% for having HCM. When applying this probability threshold to the testing dataset, the CNN’s AUC was 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.95 to 0.96) with sensitivity 87\% and specificity 90\%. In subgroup analyses, the AUC was 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.94 to 0.97) among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria and 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) among patients with a normal ECG. The model performed particularly well in younger patients (sensitivity 95\%, specificity 92\%). In patients with HCM with and without sarcomeric mutations, the model-derived median probabilities for having HCM were 97\% and 96\%, respectively.
Conclusions
ECG-based detection of HCM by an artificial intelligence algorithm can be achieved with high diagnostic performance, particularly in younger patients. This model requires further refinement and external validation, but it may hold promise for HCM screening.},

In this field, sensor location has been demonstrated to play a crucial role. The goal of this study was to investigate PPG and PRV signal quality acquired from two body locations: finger and wrist. We simultaneously acquired the PPG and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals from sixteen healthy subjects (aged 28.5 \&plusmn; 3.5, seven females) who followed an experimental protocol of affective stimulation through visual stimuli. Statistical tests demonstrated that PPG signals acquired from the wrist and the finger presented different signal quality indexes (kurtosis and Shannon entropy), with higher values for the wrist-PPG. Then we propose to apply the cross-mapping (CM) approach as a new method to quantify the PRV signal quality. We found that the performance achieved using the two sites was significantly different in all the experimental sessions (p \&lt; 0.01), and the PRV dynamics acquired from the finger were the most similar to heart rate variability (HRV) dynamics.},

Whether used for screening or diagnostic purposes, ECG facilitates the detection of conditions at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). ECG interpretation standards have evolved over the last decade as scientific studies improved the division of physiological from pathological ECG changes. The Seattle Criteria (2013) provided consensus recommendations by an international panel of experts in sports cardiology and emerged as a practical guideline to improve ECG interpretation accuracy.1 In 2017, the International Criteria was released by the same expert panel and intended to supersede prior guidelines as the current standard for ECG interpretation in athletes.2 Each revision of ECG standards has improved specificity without compromising sensitivity for ECG-detectable pathological conditions associated with SCD.3–5 In a cohort of 5258 college athletes from the USA, application of the International Criteria lowered the false-positive rate compared with the Seattle Criteria from 2.8\% to just 1.3\%.3 Likewise, in a cohort of 11 168 adolescent soccer players from the UK, the total number of athletes with an abnormal ECG was reduced 57\% by moving from the Seattle Criteria (4.3\%) to the International Criteria (1.8\%).4

	abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

The main aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of abnormal ECG findings in male professional soccer players according to European Society of Cardiology's (ESC) recommendations and the Seattle criteria, and to assess the need for echocardiography. ECGs from 587 of 595 (99\%) players were recorded with ClickECG, and measurements were derived with visually adjusted on-screen calipers on the computer-based averaged PQRST complex. Echocardiographic recordings were performed with Vivid 7/i and categorized according to reference values for athlete's heart. After the initial screening, 32 (5.5\%) players were recommended for follow-up. The prevalence of abnormal ECGs was 29.3\% vs 11.2\% according to the ESC's recommendations and the Seattle criteria, respectively. None of the players with abnormal ECGs only according to the ESC's recommendations had abnormal echocardiograms. Echocardiography alone detected one player with abnormalities (athlete's heart). The Seattle criteria reduced the number of athletes with abnormal ECGs considerably compared with the ESC recommendations. Based on echocardiographic evaluations, this increased the specificity of the Seattle criteria, without increasing the number of false-negative ECGs. The need for mandatory echocardiography in soccer players seems limited.},

	abstract = {Aim To investigate the accuracy of the recently published international recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes in a large cohort of white and black adolescent soccer players.
Methods 11 168 soccer players (mean age 16.4±1.2 years) were evaluated with a health questionnaire, ECG and echocardiogram; 10 581 (95\%) of the players were male and 10 163 (91\%) were white. ECGs were retrospectively analysed according to (1) the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations, (2) Seattle criteria, (3) refined criteria and (4) the international recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes.
Results The ESC recommendations resulted in a higher number of abnormal ECGs compared with the Seattle, refined and international criteria (13.2\%, 4.3\%, 2.9\% and 1.8\%, respectively). All four criteria were associated with a higher prevalence of abnormal ECGs in black athletes compared with white athletes (ESC: 16.2\% vs 12.9\%; Seattle: 5.9\% vs 4.2\%; refined: 3.8\% vs 2.8\%; international 3.6\% vs 1.6\%; p{\textless}0.001 each). Compared with ESC recommendations, the Seattle, refined and international criteria identified a lower number of abnormal ECGs—by 67\%, 78\% and 86\%, respectively. All four criteria identified 36 (86\%) of 42 athletes with serious cardiac pathology. Compared with ESC recommendations, the Seattle criteria improved specificity from 87\% to 96\% in white athletes and 84\% to 94\% in black athletes. The international recommendations demonstrated the highest specificity for white (99\%) and black (97\%) athletes and a sensitivity of 86\%.
Conclusions The 2017 international recommendations for ECG interpretation in young athletes can be applied to adolescent athletes to detect serious cardiac disease. These recommendations perform more effectively than previous ECG criteria in both white and black adolescent soccer players.},

	abstract = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport. A variety of mostly hereditary, structural or electrical cardiac disorders are associated with SCD in young athletes, the majority of which can be identified or suggested by abnormalities on a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Whether used for diagnostic or screening purposes, physicians responsible for the cardiovascular care of athletes should be knowledgeable and competent in ECG interpretation in athletes. However, in most countries a shortage of physician expertise limits wider application of the ECG in the care of the athlete. A critical need exists for physician education in modern ECG interpretation that distinguishes normal physiological adaptations in athletes from distinctly abnormal findings suggestive of underlying pathology. Since the original 2010 European Society of Cardiology recommendations for ECG interpretation in athletes, ECG standards have evolved quickly, advanced by a growing body of scientific data and investigations that both examine proposed criteria sets and establish new evidence to guide refinements. On 26–27 February 2015, an international group of experts in sports cardiology, inherited cardiac disease, and sports medicine convened in Seattle, Washington (USA), to update contemporary standards for ECG interpretation in athletes. The objective of the meeting was to define and revise ECG interpretation standards based on new and emerging research and to develop a clear guide to the proper evaluation of ECG abnormalities in athletes. This statement represents an international consensus for ECG interpretation in athletes and provides expert opinion-based recommendations linking specific ECG abnormalities and the secondary evaluation for conditions associated with SCD.},

	abstract = {Background— US high schools are increasingly adopting automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for use in campus settings. We analyzed the effectiveness of emergency response planning for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in a large cohort of US high schools that had onsite AED programs.Methods and Results— A cohort of US high schools with at least 1 onsite AED was identified from the National Registry for AED Use in Sports. A school representative completed a comprehensive survey on emergency planning and provided details of any SCA incident occurring within 6 months of survey completion. Surveys were completed between December 2006 and July 2007. In total, 1710 high schools with an onsite AED program were studied. Although 83\% (1428 of 1710) of schools have an established emergency response plan for SCA, only 40\% practice and review the plan at least annually with potential school responders. A case of SCA was reported by 36 of 1710 schools (2.1\%). The 36 SCA victims included 14 high school student athletes (mean age, 16 years; range, 14 to 17 years) and 22 older nonstudents (mean age, 57 years; range, 42 to 71 years) such as employees and spectators. No cases were reported in student nonathletes. Of the 36 SCA cases, 35 (97\%) were witnessed, 34 (94\%) received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 30 (83\%) received an AED shock. Twenty-three SCA victims (64\%) survived to hospital discharge, including 9 of the 14 student athletes and 14 of the 22 older nonstudents.Conclusions— School-based AED programs provide a high survival rate for both student athletes and older nonstudents who suffer SCA on school grounds. High schools are strongly encouraged to implement onsite AED programs as part of a comprehensive emergency response plan to SCA.},

	abstract = {Background—The true incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in US athletes is unknown. Current estimates are based largely on case identification through public media reports and estimated participation rates. The purpose of this study was to more precisely estimate the incidence of SCD in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) student-athletes and assess the accuracy of traditional methods for collecting data on SCD.Methods and Results—From January 2004 through December 2008, all cases of sudden death in NCAA student-athletes were identified by use of an NCAA database, weekly systematic search of public media reports, and catastrophic insurance claims. During the 5-year period, there were 273 deaths and a total of 1 969 663 athlete participant-years. Of these 273 deaths, 187 (68\%) were due to nonmedical or traumatic causes, 80 (29\%) to medical causes, and 6 (2\%) to unknown causes. Cardiovascular-related sudden death was the leading cause of death in 45 (56\%) of 80 medical cases, and represented 75\% of sudden deaths during exertion. The incidence of SCD was 1:43 770 participants per year. Among NCAA Division I male basketball players, the rate of SCD was 1:3100 per year. Thirty-nine (87\%) of the 45 cardiac cases were identified in the NCAA database, only 25 (56\%) by use of public media reports, and 9 (20\%) from catastrophic claims data.Conclusions—SCD is the leading medical cause of death and death during exercise in NCAA student-athletes. Current methods of data collection underestimate the risk of SCD. Accurate assessment of SCD incidence is necessary to shape appropriate health policy decisions and develop effective strategies for prevention.},

The impact of such a program on prevention of sudden cardiovascular death in the athlete remains to be determined.ObjectiveTo analyze trends in incidence rates and cardiovascular causes of sudden death in young competitive athletes in relation to preparticipation screening.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA population-based study of trends in sudden cardiovascular death in athletic and nonathletic populations aged 12 to 35 years in the Veneto region of Italy between 1979 and 2004. A parallel study examined trends in cardiovascular causes of disqualification from competitive sports in 42 386 athletes undergoing preparticipation screening at the Center for Sports Medicine in Padua (22 312 in the early screening period [1982-1992] and 20 074 in the late screening period [1993-2004]).Main Outcome MeasuresIncidence trends of total cardiovascular and cause-specific sudden death in screened athletes and unscreened nonathletes of the same age range over a 26-year period.ResultsDuring the study period, 55 sudden cardiovascular deaths occurred in screened athletes (1.9 deaths/100 000 person-years) and 265 sudden deaths in unscreened nonathletes (0.79 deaths/100 000 person-years). The annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular death in athletes decreased by 89\% (from 3.6/100 000 person-years in 1979-1980 to 0.4/100 000 person-years in 2003-2004; P for trend \&lt; .001), whereas the incidence of sudden death among the unscreened nonathletic population did not change significantly. The mortality decline started after mandatory screening was implemented and persisted to the late screening period. Compared with the prescreening period (1979-1981), the relative risk of sudden cardiovascular death in athletes was 0.56 in the early screening period (95\% CI, 0.29-1.15; P = .04) and 0.21 in the late screening period (95\% CI, 0.09-0.48; P = .001). Most of the reduced mortality was due to fewer cases of sudden death from cardiomyopathies (from 1.50/100 000 person-years in the prescreening period to 0.15/100 000 person-years in the late screening period; P for trend = .002). During the study period, 879 athletes (2.0\%) were disqualified from competition due to cardiovascular causes at the Center for Sports Medicine: 455 (2.0\%) in the early screening period and 424 (2.1\%) in the late screening period. The proportion of athletes who were disqualified for cardiomyopathies increased from 20 (4.4\%) of 455 in the early screening period to 40 (9.4\%) of 424 in the late screening period (P = .005).ConclusionsThe incidence of sudden cardiovascular death in young competitive athletes has substantially declined in the Veneto region of Italy since the introduction of a nationwide systematic screening. Mortality reduction was predominantly due to a lower incidence of sudden death from cardiomyopathies that paralleled the increasing identification of athletes with cardiomyopathies at preparticipation screening.},

Because of the large number of genes and alleles attributed to DCM, comprehensive genetic testing encompasses ever-increasing gene panels. Genetic diagnosis can help predict prognosis, especially with regard to arrhythmia risk for certain subtypes. Moreover, cascade genetic testing in family members can identify those who are at risk or with early stage disease, offering the opportunity for early intervention. This review will address diagnosis and management of DCM, including the role of genetic evaluation. We will also overview distinct genetic pathways linked to DCM and their pathogenetic mechanisms. Historically, cardiac morphology has been used to classify cardiomyopathy subtypes. Determining genetic variants is emerging as an additional adjunct to help further refine subtypes of DCM, especially where arrhythmia risk is increased, and ultimately contribute to clinical management.},

	abstract = {Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a condition also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), is a genetic disorder of the myocardium. ARVC/D is due to fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall. This results from the mutation of genes and can cause sudden death in young people and athletes.[1] It was first identified in 1977 by Guy Fontaine. An essential feature of this disease is the development of ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block pattern. It commonly presents during exercise.[2] Identification of this disease can prevent death in patients with the disease by doing preventive measures. Genetic testing is essential in their family members to identify at-risk individuals.},

	abstract = {Temporal trends of the prevalence and incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been well established in Asian populations. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Services database, we identified patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM between 2010 and 2016. The annual prevalence and incidence of HCM, and their clinical characteristics were investigated. The prevalence of HCM has increased from 0.016\% (n = 6313) in 2010 to 0.031\% (n = 13,035) in 2016. During a 7-year period, 13,229 patients were newly diagnosed with HCM. The incidence rate increased from 4.15 (per 100,000 person-years) in 2010 to 5.6 in 2016. The prevalence and incidence of HCM increased with age and peaked during the 70s, with male predominance in all age groups. Chest pain is the most frequent clinical presentation followed by shortness of breath and syncope. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the two most common comorbidities. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in about 1/3 and 1/4 of patients with HCM, respectively. The prevalence and incidence of HCM gradually increased from 2010 to 2016, possibly due to heightened recognition of the disease. Given the progressively high incidence of HCM with age and high prevalence of coexisting modifiable risk factors, continued efforts are required to increase awareness regarding HCM-related symptoms and potential complications.},

	abstract = {Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in medicine and healthcare. Deep learning methods have achieved promising results predictive healthcare tasks using ECG signals.
Objective: This paper conducts a systematic review of deep learning methods on ECG data from both model and application perspectives.
Methods: We extracted papers that deploy deep learning (deep neural networks) models on ECG data that published between January 1st 2010 and February 29th 2020 from Google Scholar, PubMed, and DBLP. We then analyze them in three aspects, including task, model, and data. Last we discuss open challenges and unsolved problems in this area.
Results: The total number of papers is 191; among them, 108 papers are published after the year 2019. Almost all kinds of common deep learning architectures have been used in ECG analytics tasks like disease detection/classiﬁcation, annotation/localization, sleep staging, biometric human identiﬁcation, denoising, and so on.
Conclusion: The number of works about deep learning on Electrocardiogram data is growing explosively in recent years. Indeed, these works have achieved a far better performance in terms of accuracy. However, there are some new challenges and problems like interpretability, scalability, efﬁciency, which need to be addressed and paid more attention. Moreover, it is also worth investigating by discovering new interesting applications from both the dataset view and the method view.},

	abstract = {Automatic detection of arrhythmia is of great significance for early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Traditional feature engineering methods based on expert knowledge lack multidimensional and multi-view information abstraction and data representation ability, so the traditional research on pattern recognition of arrhythmia detection cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, with the increase of deep learning technology, automatic feature extraction of ECG data based on deep neural networks has been widely discussed. In order to utilize the complementary strength between different schemes, in this paper, we propose an arrhythmia detection method based on the multi-resolution representation (MRR) of ECG signals. This method utilizes four different up to date deep neural networks as four channel models for ECG vector representations learning. The deep learning based representations, together with hand-crafted features of ECG, forms the MRR, which is the input of the downstream classification strategy. The experimental results of big ECG dataset multi-label classification confirm that the F1 score of the proposed method is 0.9238, which is 1.31\%, 0.62\%, 1.18\% and 0.6\% higher than that of each channel model. From the perspective of architecture, this proposed method is highly scalable and can be employed as an example for arrhythmia recognition.},

              Aims 
              Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has a high incidence and clinical importance, the conventional diagnosis criteria for detecting LVH using electrocardiography (ECG) has not been satisfied. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for detecting LVH.
            
            
              Methods and results
              This retrospective cohort study involved the review of 21 286 patients who were admitted to two hospitals between October 2016 and July 2018 and underwent 12-lead ECG and echocardiography within 4 weeks. The patients in one hospital were divided into a derivation and internal validation dataset, while the patients in the other hospital were included in only an external validation dataset. An AI algorithm based on an ensemble neural network (ENN) combining convolutional and deep neural network was developed using the derivation dataset. And we visualized the ECG area that the AI algorithm used to make the decision. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the AI algorithm based on ENN was 0.880 (95\% confidence interval 0.877–0.883) and 0.868 (0.865–0.871) during the internal and external validations. These results significantly outperformed the cardiologist’s clinical assessment with Romhilt-Estes point system and Cornell voltage criteria, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of ECG machine. At the same specificity, the AI algorithm based on ENN achieved 159.9\%, 177.7\%, and 143.8\% higher sensitivities than those of the cardiologist’s assessment, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of ECG machine.
            
            
              Conclusion 
              An AI algorithm based on ENN was highly able to detect LVH and outperformed cardiologists, conventional methods, and other machine learning techniques.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an uncommon but important cause of sudden cardiac death.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to develop an artiﬁcial intelligence approach for the detection of HCM based on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).
METHODS A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and validated using digital 12-lead ECG from 2,448 patients with a veriﬁed HCM diagnosis and 51,153 non-HCM age- and sex-matched control subjects. The ability of the CNN to detect HCM was then tested on a different dataset of 612 HCM and 12,788 control subjects.
RESULTS In the combined datasets, mean age was 54.8 Æ 15.9 years for the HCM group and 57.5 Æ 15.5 years for the control group. After training and validation, the area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN in the validation dataset was 0.95 (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.94 to 0.97) at the optimal probability threshold of 11\% for having HCM. When applying this probability threshold to the testing dataset, the CNN’s AUC was 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.95 to 0.96) with sensitivity 87\% and speciﬁcity 90\%. In subgroup analyses, the AUC was 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.94 to 0.97) among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria and 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) among patients with a normal ECG. The model performed particularly well in younger patients (sensitivity 95\%, speciﬁcity 92\%). In patients with HCM with and without sarcomeric mutations, the model-derived median probabilities for having HCM were 97\% and 96\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS ECG-based detection of HCM by an artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm can be achieved with high diagnostic performance, particularly in younger patients. This model requires further reﬁnement and external validation, but it may hold promise for HCM screening. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2020;75:722–33) © 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

	abstract = {Automatic arrhythmia detection from Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a simpler, more noise-immune solution than traditional methods in multi-class arrhythmia classiﬁcation. However, suﬀering from lack of consideration for temporal feature of ECG signal, CNN couldn’t accept varied-length ECG signal and had limited performance in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. To address these issues, we proposed attention-based time-incremental convolutional neural network (ATI-CNN), a deep neural network model achieving both spatial and temporal fusion of information from ECG signals by integrating CNN, recurrent cells and attention module. Comparing to CNN model, this model features ﬂexible input length, halved parameter amount as well as more than 90\% computation reduction in real-time processing. The experiment result shows that, ATI-CNN reached an overall classiﬁcation accuracy of 81.2\%. In comparison with a classical 16-layer CNN named VGGNet, ATI-CNN achieved accuracy increases of 7.7\% in average and up to 26.8\% in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. Combining all these excellent features, ATI-CNN oﬀered an exempliﬁcation for all kinds of varied-length signal processing problems.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal evaluation is routinely used in clinics as a signiﬁcant diagnostic method for detecting arrhythmia. However, it is very labor intensive to externally evaluate ECG signals, due to their small amplitude. Using automated detection and classiﬁcation methods in the clinic can assist doctors in making accurate and expeditious diagnoses of diseases. In this study, we developed a classiﬁcation method for arrhythmia based on the combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, which was then used to diagnose eight ECG signals, including a normal sinus rhythm. The ECG data of the experiment were derived from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The experimental method mainly consisted of two parts. The input data of the model were two-dimensional grayscale images converted from one-dimensional signals, and detection and classiﬁcation of the input data was carried out using the combined model. The advantage of this method is that it does not require performing feature extraction or noise ﬁltering on the ECG signal. The experimental results showed that the implemented method demonstrated high classiﬁcation performance in terms of accuracy, speciﬁcity, and sensitivity equal to 99.01\%, 99.57\%, and 97.67\%, respectively. Our proposed model can assist doctors in accurately detecting arrhythmia during routine ECG screening.},

	abstract = {Long QT syndrom (LQTS) is a heart disorder that can cause uncontrollable arrhythmias and in some cases sudden death on healthy individuals[1]. LQTS can be an inherited disorder or provoked due to medication for treating of other medical conditions[2]. The arrhythmias can occur during exercise, as a reaction to stress or when sleeping[1]. The disorder origins from abnormal electrical signalling in the heart’s lower chambers, the ventricles[1]. In order to estimate the QT interval, the QRS onset and T offset needs to be detected in the ECG signal. A study of how the features from multilevel Discrete Wavelet Transform can be used for estimating the QT inteval has been further examined. The results shows that the algorithm developed misses the QRS onset with a mean distance of 2.53 samples, and the T offset with 9.25 samples, on a great variety of ECG morphology.},

	abstract = {Throughout civilization, animals have played a pivotal role in the advancement of science and medicine. From as early as 400 BC when Hippocrates recognized that diseases had natural causes, the steadfast advances made by biologists, scientists, physicians and scholars were fueled by timely and important facts and information- much of it gained through animal observations that contributed importantly to understanding anatomy, physiology, and pathology. There have been many breakthroughs and historic developments. For example, William Harvey in the 16th and 17th centuries clariﬁed the importance of the circulatory system, aided by observations in dogs and pigs, which helped to clarify and conﬁrm his concepts. The nineteenth century witnessed advances in physical examination techniques including auscultation and percussion. These helped create the basis for enhanced proﬁciency in clinical cardiology. An explosion of technologic advances that followed in the 20th century have made possible sophisticated, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostics. This permitted rapid patient assessment, effective monitoring, the development of new cardiotonic drugs, clinical trials to assess efﬁcacy, and multi-therapy strategies. The latter 20th century has marshaled a dizzying array of advances in medical genetics and molecular science, expanding the frontiers of etiologies and disease mechanisms in man, with important implications for animal health. Veterinary medicine has evolved during the last half century, from a trade designed to serve agrarian cultures, to a diverse profession supporting an array of career opportunities ranging from private, specialty practice, to highly organized, specialized medicine and subspecialty academic training programs in cardiology and allied disciplines.},

Recently, the ‘Seattle Criteria’, a series of revisions to these recommendations, was published, with the aim of improving the speciﬁcity of ECG screening in athletes.
Objectives First, to assess the prevalence of ECG abnormalities in a cohort of elite Australian athletes using the 2010 ESC recommendations and determine how often group 2 ECG changes correlate with the evidence of signiﬁcant cardiac pathology on further investigation. Second, to assess the impact of the ‘Seattle Criteria’ in reducing the number of athletes with ECG abnormalities in whom further cardiac testing is unremarkable (‘false positives’). Design 1197 elite athletes underwent cardiovascular screening between 2011 and 2012, of whom 1078 aged 16–35 years volunteered and were eligible to participate.
Results 186 (17.3\%) had an abnormal ECG according to ESC recommendations and a further 30 (2.8)\% had unclassiﬁed changes. Three athletes (0.3\%) were found to have a cardiac abnormality on further investigation. Using the Seattle Criteria, the number of athletes classiﬁed as abnormal fell to 48 (4.5\%, p{\textless}0.0001) and the three with an underlying cardiac abnormality were still identiﬁed. The improved speciﬁcity was due to reclassiﬁcation of 71 athletes (6.6\%) with an equivocal QTc interval, 42 (3.9\%) with T wave inversion isolated to V1–2 and 22 (2\%) with either isolated right axis deviation or right ventricular hypertrophy on voltage criteria.

	abstract = {Respiratory rate (RR) is a key parameter used in healthcare for monitoring and predicting patient deterioration. However, continuous and automatic estimation of this parameter from wearable sensors is still a challenging task. Various methods have been proposed to estimate RR from wearable sensors using windowed segments of the data; e.g., often using a minimum of 32 s. Little research has been reported in the literature concerning the instantaneous detection of respiratory rate from such sources. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a method to estimate instantaneous respiratory rate (IRR) from body-worn reﬂectance photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. The proposed method relies on a nonlinear time-frequency representation, termed the wavelet synchrosqueezed transform (WSST). We apply the latter to derived modulations of the PPG that arise from the act of breathing.We validate the proposed algorithm using (i) a custom device with a PPG probe placed on various body positions and (ii) a commercial wrist-worn device (WaveletHealth Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). Comparator reference data were obtained via a thermocouple placed under the nostrils, providing ground-truth information concerning respiration cycles. Tracking instantaneous frequencies was performed in the joint time-frequency spectrum of the (4 Hz re-sampled) respiratory-induced modulation using the WSST, from data obtained from 10 healthy subjects. The estimated instantaneous respiratory rates have shown to be highly correlated with breath-by-breath variations derived from the reference signals. The proposed method produced more accurate results compared to averaged RR obtained using 32 s windows investigated with overlap between successive windows of (i) zero and (ii) 28 s. For a set of ﬁve healthy subjects, the averaged similarity between reference RR and instantaneous RR, given by the longest common subsequence (LCSS) algorithm, was calculated as 0.69; this compares with averaged similarity of 0.49 using 32 s windows with 28 s overlap between successive windows. The results provide insight into estimation of IRR and show that upper body positions produced PPG signals from which a better respiration signal was extracted than for other body locations.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Photoplethysmography (PPG) has been widely used to assess cardiovascular function. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated the effect of measurement site on PPG waveform characteristics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative comparison on this.
Methods: Thirty six healthy subjects participated in this study. For each subject, PPG signals were sequentially recorded for 1 min from six different body sites (ﬁnger, wrist under (anatomically volar), wrist upper (dorsal), arm, earlobe, and forehead) under both normal and deep breathing patterns. For each body site under a certain breathing pattern, the mean amplitude was ﬁrstly derived from recorded PPG waveform which was then normalized to derive several waveform characteristics including the pulse peak time (Tp), dicrotic notch time (Tn), and the reﬂection index (RI). The effects of breathing pattern and measurement site on the waveform characteristics were ﬁnally investigated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc multiple comparisons.
Results: Under both breathing patterns, the PPG measurements from the ﬁnger achieved the highest percentage of analyzable waveforms for extracting waveform characteristics. There were signiﬁcant effects of breathing pattern on Tn and RI (larger Tn and smaller RI with deep breathing on average, both p {\textless} 0.03). The effects of measurement site on mean amplitude, Tp, Tn, and RI were signiﬁcant (all p {\textless} 0.001). The key results were that, under both breathing patterns, the mean amplitude from ﬁnger PPG was signiﬁcantly larger and its Tp and RI were signiﬁcantly smaller than those from the other ﬁve sites (all p {\textless} 0.001, except p = 0.04 for the Tp of “wrist under”), and Tn was only signiﬁcantly larger than that from the earlobe (both p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion: This study has quantitatively conﬁrmed the effect of PPG measurement site on PPG waveform characteristics (including mean amplitude, Tp, Tn, and RI), providing scientiﬁc evidence for a better understanding of the PPG waveform variations between different body sites.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this paper was to compare photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals measured from the wrist and finger and to evaluate if wrist PPG signal could be used to calculate pulse arrival time (PAT), the time delay between electrocardiogram (ECG) R peak and a feature (e.g. peak, foot, first derivative peak) in the PPG signal. Further, the correlation between pulse wave velocity (rePWV, defined as PWV from ECG R peak to extremity) and systolic blood pressure was studied. Approach: Thirty subjects were measured at rest by a trained research nurse. For reference measurement, chest ECG and finger PPG were measured using commercial sensors. Wrist PPG and arm ECG were measured with a custom-made setup, where the PPG sensor was located at the back surface of the forearm. Main results: Reference finger and wrist PPG signals were found to differ in shape and also in amplitude. The PPG foot or first derivative peak detection methods seemed to be the most suitable methods for wrist PAT calculation. The Pearson correlation coefficient between blood pressure and rePWV was found to be 0.44 for the reference finger measurement and 0.37 for the wrist measurement. Significance: Wrist PPG signal is widely used in optical heart rate monitors. Based on the results obtained in this study, wrist PPG signal may be used also for PAT calculation. The use of PAT for blood pressure estimation still has challenges, but PAT as such could be used as an interesting indicator of vascular health.},

	abstract = {The velocity of the propagating arterial pulse wave (pulse wave velocity, PWV) has been proposed as an unobtrusive and possibly continuous surrogate measure of systolic blood pressure (SBP). PWV is derived from the arrival time of the blood pulse at a peripheral arterial location, most often the ﬁnger. Reported performances were not yet accurate enough for clinical application but good enough as an unobtrusive surrogate in other settings. However, the ﬁnger PPG is not an ideal location in the home setting as it obstructs hand movement and can suffer from peripheral vasomotion and orthostatic pressure changes. In this paper we examine the viability of other pulse arrival locations for the measurement of PWV. PWV was derived to the ﬁnger (most common location), wrist (less obtrusive location), ear (more proximal) and ankle (more distal). Correlation analysis for PWV from each location with SBP was performed and the calibration procedure was studied. Wrist PWV accuracy is found to be comparable to ﬁnger PWV in terms of correlation and estimation error with SBP. The ear PWV, being a theoretically favorable location, is shown to have a larger inter-subject variance in the calibration procedure compared to other locations. Ankle PWV shows stable calibration parameters across subjects but Bland-Altmann analysis reveals unusual error trends. In conclusion, while results indicate that all sensor locations are usable to some extent, there are still some distinct properties associated with each sensor location that should be taken into account when designing an SBP algorithm based on PWV.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography(PPG) as a non-invasive tool for monitoring various cardiovascular parameters, has become popular due to the ease of wearable integration and pervasive nature. Due to unobtrusive nature of sensor placement at wrist, smartwatches and wrist based ﬁtness bands have gained popularity. However, any movement of the wrist along with frequent loose contacts signiﬁcantly corrupts the PPG signal. Reliable peak detection from the corrupted PPG signal is essential for any further processing, as many physiological quantities such as heart rate variability (HRV) depends on the peak-to-peak distances in the PPG signal, known as the RR Series. This paper attempts to provide a robust algorithm for peak detection in noise \& motion artefact corrupted PPG signals. The algorithm consists of steps to remove the baseline drift in the PPG signal using wavelet ﬁltering and trend removal and subsequent peak detection using autcorrelation for each pseudo-periodic segment of the signal. The validation of the method is done by comparing the PPG peaks detected by the algorithm with RR series extracted from simultaneously captured ECG signal.},

	abstract = {Background: The term endurance sport (ES) is broadly used to characterize any exercise that requires maintenance of high cardiac output over extended time. However, the relative amount of isotonic (volume) versus isometric (pressure) cardiac stress varies across ES disciplines. To what degree ES-mediated cardiac remodeling varies, as a function of superimposed isometric stress, is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the cardiac remodeling characteristics associated with two common yet physiologically distinct forms of ES.
Methods: Healthy competitive male long-distance runners (high isotonic, low isometric stress; n = 40) and rowers (high isotonic, high isometric stress; n = 40) were comparatively studied after 3 months of sportspeciﬁc exercise training with conventional and speckle-tracking two-dimensional echocardiography.
Results: Rowers demonstrated dilated left ventricular (LV) volumes and elevated LV mass (i.e., eccentric LV hypertrophy), whereas runners demonstrated normal LV mass (runners, 88 6 11 g/m2; rowers, 108 6 13 g/ m2; P {\textless} .001) despite comparatively larger LV volumes (runners, 101 6 10 mL/m2; rowers, 89 6 13 mL/m2; P {\textless} .001) consistent with eccentric LV remodeling. Increasing LV mass was associated with increased reliance on early diastolic ﬁlling (LV mass vs E0/A0 ratio, R = 0.47, P {\textless} .001) indicating ‘‘mass-dependent’’ diastolic function. Right ventricular dilation of similar magnitude and LV systolic function, as assessed by numerous complementary indices, were similar in both groups.
Conclusions: Cardiac adaptations differ signiﬁcantly as a function of ES discipline. Further work is required to determine the mechanisms for this differential adaptation, to develop deﬁnitive ES discipline-speciﬁc normative values, and to evaluate the optimal therapeutic use of speciﬁc ES disciplines among patients with common cardiovascular diseases.

	abstract = {Long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), which have recently emerged in sequential data analysis, are the most widely used type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) architecture. Progress on the topic of deep learning includes successful adaptations of deep versions of these architectures. In this study, a new model for deep bidirectional LSTM network-based wavelet sequences called DBLSTM-WS was proposed for classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. For this purpose, a new wavelet-based layer is implemented to generate ECG signal sequences. The ECG signals were decomposed into frequency sub-bands at different scales in this layer. These subbands are used as sequences for the input of LSTM networks. New network models that include unidirectional (ULSTM) and bidirectional (BLSTM) structures are designed for performance comparisons. Experimental studies have been performed for ﬁve different types of heartbeats obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. These ﬁve types are Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Ventricular Premature Contraction (VPC), Paced Beat (PB), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), and Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB). The results show that the DBLSTM-WS model gives a high recognition performance of 99.39\%. It has been observed that the wavelet-based layer proposed in the study signiﬁcantly improves the recognition performance of conventional networks. This proposed network structure is an important approach that can be applied to similar signal processing problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on deep learning for active classiﬁcation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To this end, we learn a suitable feature representation from the raw ECG data in an unsupervised way using stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) with sparsity constraint. After this feature learning phase, we add a softmax regression layer on the top of the resulting hidden representation layer yielding the so-called deep neural network (DNN). During the interaction phase, we allow the expert at each iteration to label the most relevant and uncertain ECG beats in the test record, which are then used for updating the DNN weights. As ranking criteria, the method relies on the DNN posterior probabilities to associate conﬁdence measures such as entropy and Breaking-Ties (BT) to each test beat in the ECG record under analysis. In the experiments, we validate the method on the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database as well as two other databases called INCART, and SVDB, respectively. Furthermore, we follow the recommendations of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) for class labeling and results presentation. The results obtained show that the newly proposed approach provides signiﬁcant accuracy improvements with less expert interaction and faster online retraining compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting periodic abnormal waves in ECG. This method is based on the deep neural network model that learns wave’s shape and their temporal relevance by combing AutoEncoder and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

	abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are widely used to gauge the health of the human heart, and the resulting time series signal is often analyzed manually by a medical professional to detect any arrhythmia that the patient may have suffered. Much work has been done to automate the process of analyzing ECG signals, but most of the research involves extensive preprocessing of the ECG data to derive vectorized features and subsequently designing a classiﬁer to discriminate between healthy ECG signals and those indicative of an Arrhythmia. This approach requires knowledge and data of the different types of Arrhythmia for training. However, the heart is a complex organ and there are many different and new types of Arrhythmia that can occur which were not part of the original training set. Thus, it may be more prudent to adopt an anomaly detection approach towards analyzing ECG signals. In this paper, we utilize a deep recurrent neural network architecture with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to develop a predictive model for healthy ECG signals. We further utilize the probability distribution of the prediction errors from these recurrent models to indicate normal or abnormal behavior. An added advantage of using LSTM networks is that the ECG signal can be directly fed into the network without any elaborate preprocessing as required by other techniques. Also, no prior information about abnormal signals is needed by the networks as they were trained only on normal data. We have used the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to obtain ECG time series data for both normal periods and for periods during four different types of Arrhythmias, namely Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Paced Beats (PB) and Ventricular Couplet (VC). Results are promising and indicate that Deep LSTM models may be viable for detecting anomalies in ECG signals.},

METHODS A list of the authors who are members of the Cardiology Consensus Group of the English Football Association is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. N Engl J Med 2018;379:524-34. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1714719 From 1996 through 2016, we screened 11,168 adolescent athletes with a mean (±SD) age of 16.4±1.2 years (95\% of whom were male) in the English Football Association (FA) cardiac screening program, which consisted of a health questionnaire, physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. The FA registry was interrogated to identify sudden cardiac deaths, which were confirmed with autopsy reports. Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.
RESULTS During screening, 42 athletes (0.38\%) were found to have cardiac disorders that are associated with sudden cardiac death. A further 225 athletes (2\%) with congenital or valvular abnormalities were identified. After screening, there were 23 deaths from any cause, of which 8 (35\%) were sudden deaths attributed to cardiac disease. Cardiomyopathy accounted for 7 of 8 sudden cardiac deaths (88\%). Six athletes (75\%) with sudden cardiac death had had normal cardiac screening results. The mean time between screening and sudden cardiac death was 6.8 years. On the basis of a total of 118,351 person-years, the incidence of sudden cardiac death among previously screened adolescent soccer players was 1 per 14,794 person-years (6.8 per 100,000 athletes).
CONCLUSIONS Diseases that are associated with sudden cardiac death were identified in 0.38\% of adolescent soccer players in a cohort that underwent cardiovascular screening. The incidence of sudden cardiac death was 1 per 14,794 person-years, or 6.8 per 100,000 athletes; most of these deaths were due to cardiomyopathies that had not been detected on screening.

	abstract = {Objective: Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is a common type of heart rhythm abnormality caused by a problem with the heart’s electrical system. Early detection of this disease has important implications for stroke prevention and management. Our objective is to construct an intelligent tool that assists cardiologists in identifying automatically cardiac arrhythmias and noise in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Approach: Our base deep classiﬁer combined a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) and a sequence of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, with pooling, dropout and normalization techniques to improve their accuracy. The network predicted a classiﬁcation at every 18th input sample and the ﬁnal prediction was selected for classiﬁcation. Ten standalone models that used our base classiﬁer architecture were ﬁrst cross-validated separately on 90\% of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 dataset and then tested on 10\%. An ensemble classiﬁer selected the label of the best average probability from the ten sub-models to improve prediction quality. Main results: Our original result submitted to the challenge gave a mean F1-measure of 80\%. The new proposed method improved the test score to 82\% in the follow-up phase of the challenge. Signiﬁcance: Without employing a time-consuming feature engineering step, the ensemble classiﬁer trained with this architecture provided a robust solution to the problem of detecting cardiac arrhythmia from noisy ECG signals. In addition, interpretation of the classiﬁer by inspection of its network parameters and predictions revealed what aspects of the ECG signal the classiﬁer considered most discriminating.},

Beginning with the hypothesis and the research design, the methodological framework for making inferences based on measurements and statistical analysis is explained. This is followed by a brief discussion on correlated measurements and data reduction before an overview is given of statistical methods for comparison of groups, factor analysis, association, regression and prediction, explained in the context of bioimpedance research. The last chapter is dedicated to the validation of a new method by different measures of performance. A flowchart is presented for selection of statistical method, and a table is given for an overview of the most important terms of performance when evaluating new measurement technology.},

	abstract = {Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a non-invasive tool for assessing the hemodynamic parameters. It has been used for diagnosing several cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and valvular diseases. Particularly, the valvular heart disease is characterized by the damage in one of the four heart valves: the mitral, aortic, tricuspid or pulmonary valves. The mitral valve insufficiency and the aortic valve stenos are the most frequent valve diseases in the world. In this paper, we propose to diagnosis the mitral valve insufficiency using the impedance cardiography technique. The study group consisted of 40 subjects (20 control subjects and 20 patients with mitral insufficiency). A parameter “I” is calculated from the impedance cardiogram waveform and it is used to differentiate control subjects from patients with mitral insufficiency. The parameter “I” was related significantly to the abnormalities of the impedance cardiogram waveform. For patients with mitral insufficiency, “I” was higher than for the healthy subjects with a difference ratio of 89\% (p{\textless}0.001). To improve the diagnosis, we determined the stroke volume, cardiac output, and other hemodynamic parameters for the two groups of subjects. Finally, we concluded that we could identify, easily, patients with mitral insufficiency based on the abnormalities of the impedance cardiogram tracings and a characteristic parameter “I”.},

	abstract = {During the last decades the use of electrical bioimpedance (EBI) in the medical field has been the subject of extensive research, as an affordable, harmless and non-invasive technology. In some specific applications, such as body composition assessment where EBI has proven a good degree of effectiveness and reliability, the use of textile electrodes and measurement garments have shown good performance and reproducible results. Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a modality of EBI that can benefit from the implementation and use of wearable sensors. ICG is based on continuous impedance measurements of a longitudinal segment across the thorax taken at a single frequency. The need for a specific electrode placement on the thorax and neck can be easily ensured with the use of a garment with embedded textile electrodes, also known as “textrodes.” The first step towards the implementation of garment-based ICG is to determine the quality of ICG measurements with textile sensors to allow estimation of fundamental ICG parameters. In this work, the measurement performance of a 2-belt set with incorporated textrodes for thorax and neck is compared against ICG measurements obtained with Ag/AgCl electrodes. The analysis is based on the quality of the fundamental ICG signals (∆Z, dZ/dt and ECG), systolic time intervals and other ICG parameters. The results indicate the feasibility of using textrodes for ICG measurements with consistent measurements and relatively low data dispersion. Thus, enabling the development of measuring garments for ICG measurements.},

The clinical relevance of this time interval is subject of study. This paper introduces a method using ISTI to evaluate and predict the circulatory response to fluid administration in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and presents preliminary results of a pilot study by comparing ISTI with cardiac output (CO) responsiveness. Also the use of the pulse transit time (PTT), earlier recommended for this purpose, was investigated. The results showed an inverse relationship between ISTI and CO at all moments of fluid administration and also an inverse relationship between the changes ΔISTI and ΔCO before and after full fluid administration. No relationships between PTT and CO or ΔPTT and ΔCO were found. It is concluded that ISTI is dependent upon preload, and that ISTI has the potential to be used as a clinical parameter assessing preload.},

However, the duration of the ISTI has not yet been compared to other time markers of the heart cycle. The present study gauges the duration of the ISTI by comparing the end point of this interval, the Cpoint, with heart cycle markers obtained by echocardiography. The heart rate of 16 healthy subjects was varied by means of an exercise stimulus. It was found that the C-point, and therefore the end point of ISTI, occurred around the moment of the maximum diameter of the aortic arch in all subjects and at all heart rates. However, while the time difference between the opening of the aortic valves and the maximum diameter of the aortic arch decreased significantly with decreasing RR-interval, the time difference with respect to the moment of the C-point remained constant within the subjects. This means that the shortening of the ISTI with increasing heart rate in response to an exercise stimulus was caused by a shortening of the pre-ejection period (PEP). It is concluded that the ISTI can be used as a non-invasive parameter indicating the time difference between the electrical and mechanical pumping activity of the heart, both inside and outside the clinic.},

ISTI showed substantial variability during these manoeuvres. The tests showed that the variability of RR and ISTI was substantially different between PD patients and controls. It is hypothesized that in PD patients the sympathetic nervous system compensates for the loss of regulatory control function of the blood-pressure by the parasympathetic system. It is concluded that ISTI is a practical, additional and independent parameter that can be used to assist other tests in evaluating autonomic nervous control of the heart in PD patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A key aim of triage is to identify those with high risk of cardiac arrest, as they require intensive monitoring, resuscitation facilities, and early intervention. We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS).
Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death.
Results: From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95\% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95\% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score ≥ 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1\%, specificity of 72.3\% and negative predictive value of 98.8\%. A cutoff MEWS ≥ 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4\%, specificity of 54.2\% and negative predictive value of 97.8\%.
Conclusion: We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction.},
